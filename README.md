# MonteCarloTreeSearch

Tentative to build a general monte carlo tree search AI for modern two players game in javascript.

## Games implemented:

### Tic Tac Toe

I don't think [Tic Tac Toe](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11901/tic-tac-toe) needs any introduction.

Current implementation is unbeatable (if you give it enough time to calculate the next move).

### Connect Four

[Connect four](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2719/connect-four) is a well known two player perfect information game where players place alternatively a rounf piece in a column and try to form a 4-in-a-row.

### Quarto

[Quarto](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/681/quarto) is a two player perfect information game with a clever twist: your opponent chooses the piece you have to place on the board.

The current implementation fills up the memory of the browser very quickly.

## Game in development

### Splendor

[Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shopsâ€”all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.

This is an engine-building game for two to four players.

Currently in development for two players on its own branch.

### 7 Wonders Duel

[7 Wonders Duel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173346/7-wonders-duel) is a two player adaptation of the well known game 7 Wonders. The two players build their civilisation and try to best the opponent in Military, Science or Victory Points.
